I study how warming and temperature extremes shape coastal marine ecosystems in the Baltic Sea. My work combines mesocosm experiments, community ecology, and trait‑based approaches to understand how species and interactions respond to environmental change.

## Temperature Change & Marine Heatwaves

I investigate how gradual warming and marine heatwaves affect the structure and functioning of shallow coastal communities. This includes looking at species performance, community shifts, and overall system stability.

## Mesocosm Experiments

I run controlled multispecies experiments across temperature gradients to track changes in abundance, biomass, traits, and interactions over time. These experiments help reveal which organisms or functional groups drive ecosystem responses under warming.

## Species Interactions

I explore how warming reshapes trophic and non‑trophic interactions, such as competition, mutualism, commensalism and ammensalism. Understanding these changes helps predict how future warming will influence coastal ecosystems.
