I am a PhD student (Environmental and Marine Biology) at Åbo Akademi University. I use mesocosm experiments to study how temperature gradients and marine heatwaves affect temperate coastal ecosystems, from individual species to communities and their interactions.
Keywords: Extreme temperatures, Marine heatwaves, Mesocosms, Ecological networks, Trophic & non-trophic interactions
